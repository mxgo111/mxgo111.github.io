                        I consider 2021 another "developmental" year in terms of my fitness journey. I certainly didn't know nothing coming into the year, but I definitely know a lot more now. Because I don't have a thorough documentation of my progress in the first 9 months of my fitness journey that I started in April 2020, I'll include content in this post from my fitness journey in 2020 as well, so this is a bit more than a one-year reflection. It's a bit embarrassing to think about the lack of knowledge I had when I first started getting serious about exercising (for instance, I thought I could learn to planche push-up in 3 months after learning my first pull-up! &#128517), but I suppose everyone has to start somewhere. My hope is that this post can be 1) inspiring or educational for the reader and 2) a record of my current thoughts for my future self. <br /> <br />

                        Growing up, I was never a particularly athletic kid. I played a bit of tennis in elementary school and middle school and even played on the school team as first doubles in 8th grade, but I dropped it in high school. I also ran cross country in 7th grade and had a 7 minute-ish mile, which was above average. I had no strength and was unable to curl 15 lbs at the start of my senior year in high school.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        During the second half of my senior year, I enrolled in a local Anytime Fitness with my friend Rex, an international student from China staying at home with me. We would go around 3 times a week, on and off, but I knew very little about workout splits and had no rigorous routines. I stayed at the gym for 40 minutes and then leaving due to lack of motivation. The few times I tried benching, I benched a max of 85 pounds.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Then I left for college in August 2019, and I was very inconsistent in my freshman year about working out. All in all, I don't think I really made too much progress before April 2020, especially due to my lack of consistency. However, my conversations with Rex before college often revolved around fitness and how to improve, and in hindsight these conversations fueled my journey later on.

                        Harvard University kicked all of their students off campus in March 2020, and I arrived home feeling disillusioned and unmotivated. The one positive during that time was that Rex was still at our home as a junior in high school, and he was taking courses online as well. We wanted to restart our workout routine but didn't feel like gyms were safe, so we took up calisthenics (bodyweight training). Our training split looked like:

                        So much of this routine was wrong at worst and unoptimal at best, but we had determination and pushed ourselves. Above all, we were consistent and stuck to variations of this routine for a few months. I also started to keep track of my weight: I weighted 140lbs at around 6 feet (very underweight!), and I wanted to gain weight. Unsurprisingly, though, I did not gain any muscle. I actually lost 3 pounds-ish from April to June. This was pretty disappointing, but I <a href="https://youtu.be/iz9nsEjSS1o?t=42" target="_blank">kept at it and stayed positive</a>.

                      <p>
                        As another example of my lack of understanding at the beginning, around this time I was inspired by watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pioFto9aTEQ" target="_blank">BuzzFeed's 30-day Abs Video</a> and started wanting to get a six-pack for the summer. I decided to go for an entire month only training abs. I didn't realize that a six-pack 1) does not look good on someone who is skinny ("skinny abs") and 2) does not warrant only training abs and neglecting other muscle groups. My routine looked like the following:
                      </p>

                      <center>
                        <strong>Abs (every day).</strong> <br />
                        5 repetitions of a video. The video can be one of:<br />

                        At some point I had all three videos memorized to the dot. Again, the credit I would give myself during this period of time is that I pushed myself and stayed consistent. Around this time I also started looking into nutrition and drinking protein shakes, starting with Orgain's Organic Protein. However, I did not gain too much muscle from this month because 1) I did not provide all of my muscles enough stimulus to grow and 2) I probably did not get enough protein.

                        This time period is probably the true start to my journey into calisthenics. My dad, also working from home, built a pull-up bar and dips bars in our backyard. At the start of July, I had never been able to do a pull-up in my life, and the last 4 months of exercising did not change this. Determined to change this, I began doing pull-up negatives, where I would jump to get my chin above the bar and then lower myself down slowly. I clearly remember a sunny day when, feeling particularly motivated, I forced myself to do 50 negative pull-ups to the beat of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHgv19ip-0c" target="_blank">Stronger by TheFatRat</a>. From that day on, Rex and I included at least 50 pull-ups or negatives in our pull workouts. We also switched from an upper body/lower body/abs split to a push/pull/leg split, which is more common among weight-training routines and probably more effective. Our split looked like this (up to errors in my memory, which I admit can get rather large):

                        We later transitioned our Push Day to 2 sets of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkS1-El_WlE" target="_blank">Chris Heria's Home Chest Workout</a>. At this point I think I had some substantial strength gains, as I went from not being able to do a single pull-up to being able to do 13 in a row. I could also do 40 push-ups in a row at one point in time, and I regained my initial weight loss. I rummaged through the entire Costco protein aisle and settled on Gold Standard Whey and Combat Protein Powder as my favorite powders, Kirkland Protein Bars as my favorite bars, and decided drinks were not worth the cost-to-protein ratio. I also began seeing some visible body changes from taking progress photos. Around October I compiled these photos - it's not a huge transformation, but it's 100% natural and there's a somewhat clear difference in the arms and shoulders.

                        I also began learning a lot more about calisthenics. From watching calisthenics YouTubers online, I discovered and fell in love with movements like the muscle up, human flag, front lever, planche, and handstand pushups, to name a few. Of course, I could do none of them. I made the ambitious goal of learning to muscle up by 2021, but by that time winter was approaching and the pull-up bar outside was too cold to workout on for long periods of time, so it never quite happened. Instead, Rex and I continued with our fundamental calisthenics workouts into 2021.

                      February - June 2021. The Muscle-Up!
                      </h4>

                      <p>
                        After mulling over the muscle up for a few months in late 2020, I set out a goal to learn the muscle up by the end of 2021 Spring semester. I had watched every muscle-up tutorial on YouTube at least twice, and I was especially motivated by journey videos like those of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CITpNRzwTk" target="_blank">Mike Boyd</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwwoS_9ehns" target="_blank">GeekClimber</a> on YouTube.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        I decided to rent with some friends off-campus during Spring 2021, so I started my training in a nearby playground, where there were two bars. One of them was low, at the level of my neck. Another was higher and functioned as a proper pull-up bar if I bent my knees (see the April 2021 video below). My first workout was on the dusk of a cold day with a snow-covered ground. I remember forcing myself to the park and doing the simplest of things: jumping from the ground to a straight-bar-dips position on the lower bar, just to get the feeling of what it's like to be at the top of a muscle up.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        From jumping on the low bar, I moved to jumping from the ground onto the high bar. I couldn't do this without assistance at first, so I used a resistance band to help me get up. After I could do around five reps of jumping from the ground to the top of the bar, I moved to a different park with a higher bar, where I began using smaller and smaller resistance bands to do assisted muscle ups. This process lasted at least two months.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        On the windy morning of April 22, 2021, I ran to the park playing songs from the Rocky soundtrack, skipping my optional Zoom class because I just couldn't focus. After stretching, I attempted to do a muscle up. To my great surprise and delight, it resulted in a success! I proceeded to do four more (not in a row; after resting) just to make sure I wasn't hallucinating, since I had previously experienced moments when I thought I did a muscle-up when reality told otherwise. I was ecstatic for the rest of the day and asked my friend to take a video so I could have a permanent record, which is the middle video below. I still look back extremely fondly to that day, and I honestly can't overemphasize the happiness felt in that moment of achieving the first muscle up. After that day, I kept working at the muscle up into June/July. I eventually got to the point where I could do a few cleaner L-sit muscle-ups or 5 really bad form, kipping muscle ups.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Reflecting on this particularly eventful segment of my fitness journey, I would offer a few words of critique to my past self. Of course, I am still extremely proud of the progress I made that semester, and my muscle up achievement is worth a lot to me. However, I probably could have optimized my overall fitness  better:
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              For one, I stopped all other fitness routines that semester in favor of the muscle up. This meant that all of my muscle groups outside of maybe my back and biceps suffered this semester. On the other hand, perhaps this was inevitable. Had I continued other training, maybe I would have had less motivation and focus to learn the muscle up.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              My training for the muscle up was scheduled on a "I feel like it" basis. Luckily for me, I wanted to muscle up enough that "I feel like it" was at least once every three-four days. However, this irregular training meant that I sometimes went two days in a row, which led to a small back injury that I suspect may unfortunately be chronic, since I still feel it occasionally to this day. This injury stopped my training for a good week or so, and was likely also due to my lack of knowledge about stretching and proper rest.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                      </p>

                      <h4>
                        July - December 2021. Weight-Training.
                      </h4>

                      <p>
                        I stayed in New York City over the summer, and I bought a gym membership to Blink Fitness. My plan at first was to do only calisthenics, but I was slowly becoming less enamored with the muscle-up and discouraged by my lack of progress on the handstand. On the other hand, my max bench had, without any training, increased to 125 lbs. This made me quite excited, and I hoped to hit reps with 135 lbs. My training still lacked a lot of substance and primarily revolved around "I'll do it if I feel like it". This continued into the school semester.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        On campus (finally!), I had much easier access to gyms than I did calisthenics equipment (a.k.a. an open pull-up bar). I also tried doing muscle-ups in the indoor gym pull-up bars, but the ceiling was either too short or the pull-up bar was too thick. This naturally led to my transition into traditional lifting. I had a couple of friends who had previous lifting experience who gave me a lot of advice and lifted with me, and I slowly settled into a full-body routine that I did every 2 or 3 days.
                      </p>

                      <center>
                        <strong>Full-Body Routine (every 2-3 days).</strong> <br />
                        5 sets of 5 reps of Bench<br />
                        5 sets of 5 reps of Squat<br />
                        5 sets of 5 reps of Weighted Pull-ups<br /> <br />
                      </center>

                      <p>
                        Again, I feel as though I did not properly lift this semester, as I could have optimized my routines more (why is there so little volume?). However, I stayed consistent and definitely saw improvements in my lifting strength for each of the lifts. I managed to increase my max bench to 160lbs by the end of the semester. From not squatting at all at the beginning of the semester, I could now squat 175lbs for reps. Finally, I could do 5x5 pull-ups with 35 extra pounds. Not huge, but getting somewhere.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Another great aspect of being on campus is that I did not have to cook my own food, and I could get as much food as I wanted from the dining halls. I utilized this to my full capability and almost always got two plates for both lunch and dinner. One was reserved for veggies and starches like rice/grains, while the other was for meat. Whatever meat was available that day, I would get enough to fill the plate, whether it meant 5 chicken breasts, 5 fish filets, 10 chicken drumsticks, etc. There was never any steak, which makes sense as the college tried to transition to a more sustainable diet for all. This eating and weight training helped me gain at least 10 pounds, and I now end the year at around 160 lbs. This has made me quite happy overall, especially considering all the dry chicken I had to endure to get here.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Finally, Rex is now a college freshman who is staying with us for winter break. In the past two weeks, he and I have re-registered at Anytime Fitness, and I've begun a workout journal documenting my workouts. We did a lot of research and decided on the following split, which I hope to continue for the next few months.

                        This routine will likely continue to evolve, but I hope that this optimization of the exercises based on muscle groups for supersets will allow for more efficiency, and the higher volume will lead to more muscle growth into 2022. <br /> <br />

                        Thoughts and Takeaways
                      </h3>

                      <p>
                        In the past 21 months, I've learned a lot about fitness, more than I can write down in a blog post without taking many days. For the most part, I think the details can be learned (and re-learned!) with time. Also, considering how I still consider myself an amateur, I think the best advice I can give to any readers or my future self are the general ideas I've formed in this journey.

                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Set realistic goals.</strong> When I started out, I thought I would be getting huge within 6 months. Now, I sadly realize that a lot of the magical 6 month transformations online are due to steroid use, and true progress comes from many years of work. I'm happy with what my body looks like now, but I'm also eager for it to continue to improve aesthetically. Even more importantly, I've come to realize from my muscle up journey that a lot of the calisthenics movements take a lot (LOT) of time and energy to achieve, which is why they are so impressive. I've also adjusted my timelines for these goals drastically as a result.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Learn from the pros!</strong> Had I been more informed in the past, I think my progress could have been much quicker. I recommend everyone not only exercises, but exercises <em>intelligently</em>. If you don't know how to do an exercise, search it up! If you don't know what to do at the gym, ask someone or look it up! Watch videos from reputable sources. These videos can also be super motivational. I've watched hundreds of hours of fitness videos by now, and I've listed my favorite content creators below.

                          As a sidenote, during my muscle up journey, I met an anonymous Asian guy at the park who told me he had been training calisthenics for 10 years, and he could planche/front lever/weighted muscle up/etc. Real-life people like these are truly inspirational, and I hope any particular talented reader would take this as a note to continue keeping at it to inspire us amateurs!

                          <li>
                            <strong>Learn from the pros-to-be!</strong> Another incredible source of motivation I've found is watching average people achieving amazing things just by sticking to it. I come back to these videos from time to time to remember the importance of diligence and consistency.

                            <strong>Be proud of the small achievements.</strong> If you achieve something that you couldn't do before, be happy about it! Regardless of what others can do, it's these small achievements that send the positive signals that motivate us to keep going. When I first learned to pull-up, it wasn't really impressive at all relative to any slightly fit individual. But the excitement I had motivated me to continue doing pullups, until I could do many more. Small achievements also add up, and it's not a hard movement if there aren't several progressions (intermediate steps) to be conquered along the way.

                          <li>
                            <strong>Enjoy the grind.</strong> Last of all, there will be moments where it feels impossible. It feels like you aren't improving. These moments are the toughest, and it's important to have the ability to toss out all thoughts about any goals in favor of doing the next rep. When doing the muscle up, I was stuck on one particular resistance band assisted muscle up for a month. However, I was improving, even if I didn't feel like it. Pushing past these moments is crucial to any long-term accomplishments.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Listen to your body.</strong> As much as the above goals encourage workouts, it's important to understand that a lot goes on outside of the gym/park. If you've just done a tough workout, it's important to rest a while (for me, at least a day) before going for another tough workout with the same muscle groups. If your muscles feel sore on a day, take another rest day. Getting injured is simply not worth it.

                        Goals for 2022
                      </h3>

                      <p>
                        For 2022 and future years, I intend to follow a hybrid calisthenics/lifting plan. I will bulk and lift in the fall and winter, and shred and do calisthenics in the spring and summer. My reasoning for this is that 1) I hope to have both lifting strength and calisthenic skills, 2) Calisthenics is generally more skill-based and a little less affected by shredding, whereas Lifting will see the most gains when paired with bulking, 3) Fall and Winter get pretty cold and it's nice to do calisthenics outside 4) I followed this schedule this year and I liked it. All of this is to say that I have goals for both lifting and calisthenics:
