International parity conditions, from my perspective, give mathematical theories on the relationships between exchange rates, inflation, and interest rates at a macro level. They assume no transaction costs, perfect information, perfect liquidity, and risk-neutrality among investors. Today I learned about one such conditions, known as Covered Interest Rate Parity (CIP). 

<strong>CIP</strong> states that a perfectly-hedged investment in a foreign market should give the same return as a corresponding investment in a domestic market. In other words, using the spot exchange rate to convert domestic currency to foreign currency, investing in a foreign market instrument and receiving interest, and converting the returns back to domestic currency via a previously agreed-upon forward exchange rate should give the same return as investing in a domestic market instrument and receiving interest. This is a <em>no-arbitrage</em> condition, and it can be derived as follows, assuming a one-year forward rate:
\begin{align}
1 + i_d &= S_{f/d} \cdot (1 + i_f) \cdot \frac{1}{F_{f/d}} \\
\implies F_{f/d} &= S_{f/d} \left(\frac{1+i_f}{1+i_d}\right)
\end{align}
where the last equation is written so as to determine a forward exchange rate.
